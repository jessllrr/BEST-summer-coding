What makes a language higher than the other?\n","\n","\n","> **Abstraction...**\n","I like to think of abstraction as how \"presentable\" the code is. Is it possible for a person with no programming experience to read code in this programming language and be able to interpret it with no guidance? If the answer is yes (or almost yes), this language is very abstract. Another way to think of abstraction is in terms of how much work does the program does for you. High-level languages can often accomplish a task in less commands than a low-level one.\n","\n","> **Processing time...** You would think a high-level language takes less time to process, right? Unfortunately, the abstraction present in high-level languages demands more processing time. Basically, it takes the computer more time to understand what a high-level language is saying versus a low-level language. This is because low-level languages work more on the \"computer's terms\" than high-level ones do. \n","\n","[Abstraction Diagram](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=18Wk3WOQ-JEtGUmUP_DKzZ_bl_jAiF4g7)\n","\n","### Compilers\n","For a computer to process a high-level language, the code written in the high-level language must be translated so that the computer will understand it. Like stated earlier, high-level languages abstract to the degree where the language is readable to us but not necessarily a computer. \n","\n","Therefore, to process a high-level language, its code must go through **interpreters** or **compilers**.\n","\n","> An interpreter reads the code *line by line*. At each line, it translates and performs the command indicated by the contents of the line.\n","\n","> A compiler reads the whole code and creates a translated version called an **executable**, which is just the code you wrote but translated so that the computer can understand it.\n","\n","Python uses an interpreter. \n","\n","# Now for the Fun Stuff! --------------------------------------------------\n","###Data Types and Variables\n","There are several basic data types in python: integers, floats, booleans, and strings. We use these data types to store pieces of data. For instance, the number of dogs you own, a phone number, the temperature outside, etc...\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mTwZeLZ0iHOP","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["dogs            = 2\n","phone_number    = \"815386xxxx\" # Yes, that is part of my phone number.\n","temperature     = 95.4 \n","did_I_eat_lunch = True"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gcAmfakxnKiM","colab_type":"text"},"source":["\n","\n","*   **Integers (aka int) store numeric values**, so a phone number wouldn't work here because your phone number is more like an address and doesn't really posses a significant numerical value. However, something like the amount of amount \n","*   **Floats store numerical values as a decimal**. Keep this in mind when choosing your data type. Integers do not represent whatever comes after the decimal. Floats do.\n","*   **Booleans (aka bool) store true or false values; yes or no; 1 or 0**. In python, to assign a boolean a value of true, you must type it as 'True'. Capital T and all. Same for False. These are used in if-statements, which you will learn soon.\n","* **Strings hold text and characters**. String use double quotes. \"**String**\" is a string, but **string** is not a string. Examples of strings include an address, a color of a fruit, the name of a city, etc... \n","\n","#### The way we keep track of data is by assigning data to a variable. We do this by first creating a variable and then assigning it to a piece of data. \n","\n","> First, to create a variable we need to create a variable name. Coding etiquette states this name has to make sense with the data we are storing the variable in. So if we wanted to store my dog's name, a variable called 'catName' wouldn't make sense now would it?
