# Final Project Guidelines
Hi y'all. As you know, for the final project the guidelines are pretty loose. Essentially, I just want you to build upon what you've learned about Python and/or the micro:bit.
Here is where you'll submit your final projects. Find the folder with your name on it and upload your code and any other things you think might be helpful,
like pictures or videos!
