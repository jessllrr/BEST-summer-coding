Final Project:
    I had a lot of trouble coding my project, but I was able to learn so much about the codes within Microbit and Python. The Microbit Modules helped a lot with         understanding the code and the tutorials. 

How it works: 
    I set up my breadboard exactly how we did it in class on Wednesday for the LED light. However, instead of connecting my alligator clip to the 3V I connected it     to 0 pin. Once the microbit is connected and synced up to the code if pin 0 is connected with the alligator clip then the microbit will display 1 and a giraffe.     If the pin 0 is not connected then the mircobit will display a 0 and cow (the cow on microbit looks like an upside down house). This could be a useful towl         later to add to a code.
