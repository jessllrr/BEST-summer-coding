Description: 

So for my final project, I decided to make a python based project. I really wanted to make something with python in Google Colab because it would help me hone my skills in such an important language. I chose to do the Password generator project. With that, I decided to present the code in two different ways. I wanted to make one basic set using a function and then I made another code set using userinput. 

So, for the second code block, there is a function called password with the parameters passwordNumber and passwordLength. There is already a variable initialized with all possible characters and I imported "random" so a random pattern could be created. Then, I created two nested for loops, one to print out how many passwords in total would be created, and the second forloop iterates how many characters are printed out in the password. This uses random.choice with the password numbers and password length, because random.choice returns a random item from the characters provided. Then, at the end, I would call the function, such as password(2,3) and it prints out 2 random passwords with 3 characters each. 

For my first code block, I used userinput. So I did not define any function and went straight into importing random and then using userinput for the user to enter an integer for the number of passwords and how many characters in each password. Then, I used the same nested forloop from the other code block. Then, since it is not a function, it does not have to be defined and simply prints out the random password numbers along with a length.
