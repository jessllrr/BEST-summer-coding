        "### What is Python?\n",
        "Python is an interpreted, general-purpose, high-level programming language.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the world of programming, there are **high-level**, **mid-level**, and **low-level languages**. What makes a language higher than the other?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Abstraction...**\n",
        "I like to think of abstraction as how \"presentable\" the code is. Is it possible for a person with no programming experience to read code in this programming language and be able to interpret it with no guidance? If the answer is yes (or almost yes), this language is very abstract. Another way to think of abstraction is in terms of how much work does the program does for you. High-level languages can often accomplish a task in less commands than a low-level one.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Processing time...** You would think a high-level language takes less time to process, right? Unfortunately, the abstraction present in high-level languages demands more processing time. Basically, it takes the computer more time to understand what a high-level language is saying versus a low-level language. This is because low-level languages work more on the \"computer's terms\" than high-level ones do. \n",
        "\n",
        "[Abstraction Diagram](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=18Wk3WOQ-JEtGUmUP_DKzZ_bl_jAiF4g7)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Compilers\n",
        "For a computer to process a high-level language, the code written in the high-level language must be translated so that the computer will understand it. Like stated earlier, high-level languages abstract to the degree where the language is readable to us but not necessarily a computer. \n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, to process a high-level language, its code must go through **interpreters** or **compilers**.\n",
        "\n",
        "> An interpreter reads the code *line by line*. At each line, it translates and performs the command indicated by the contents of the line.\n",
        "\n",
        "> A compiler reads the whole code and creates a translated version called an **executable**, which is just the code you wrote but translated so that the computer can understand it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses an interpreter. \n",
